# FREE TIER OPTION (RECOMMENDED): No Domain Required - 100% Free
# ============================================================================
# This configuration uses ONLY free AWS services:
# ✅ CloudFront free tier: 1TB transfer + 10M requests/month (first 12 months)
# ✅ CloudFront default domain: d1234567890.cloudfront.net (always free)
# ✅ CloudFront default SSL certificate (always free)
# ❌ No Route53 costs (queries cost $0.40 per million after free tier)
# ❌ No ACM certificate costs (not needed with default domain)
# ❌ No domain registration costs
#
# Leave domain_name and route53_zone_id empty to use CloudFront's free domain
# (e.g., d1234567890.cloudfront.net) with HTTPS support via CloudFront's default certificate

# ============================================================================
# CUSTOM DOMAIN OPTION: Requires Domain Registration (Additional Costs)
# ============================================================================
# ⚠️ This option incurs additional costs:
# - Domain registration: ~$8-15/year
# - Route53 hosted zone: First zone free, then $0.50/month per zone
# - Route53 queries: $0.40 per million queries (after free tier)
# - ACM certificate: Free, but requires Route53 for validation
#
# Uncomment and fill these if you have a custom domain:
# domain_name = "app.example.com"
# route53_zone_id = "Z1234567890ABC"

# CloudFront price class
# PriceClass_200: US/EU only (cheaper, recommended for free tier)
# PriceClass_100: All edge locations (more expensive)
# PriceClass_All: Same as PriceClass_100

# WAF Web ACL ID (optional, leave empty if not using WAF)
# Note: AWS WAF has additional costs ($5/month per web ACL + $1 per million requests)
